# CMS Project Skeleton

This repository contains a basic skeleton for a CMS using a Laravel backend and a React/Next.js frontend. It demonstrates the structure for uploading themes similar to WordPress.

- `backend/` – Laravel-based backend placeholder with an API endpoint for theme uploads.
- `frontend/` – Next.js project with a simple form to upload themes to the backend.

Both directories include their own README files with setup instructions.
