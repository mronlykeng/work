# React/Next.js CMS Frontend (Skeleton)

This is a minimal Next.js project that demonstrates uploading a theme to the backend.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. In this `frontend` directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

The app expects the backend to be running at `http://localhost:8000`.
